THE METHODS WE WILL GET TO LEARN HERE: 

1. The getTime() method returns the number of milliseconds between 
    midnight of January 1, 1970 and the specified date.
2. Date () -> With no arguments, the Date() constructor creates a Date object set
   to the current date and time.

  milliseconds âˆ’ When one numeric argument is passed, it is taken as the 
  internal numeric representation of the date in milliseconds, as returned 
  by the getTime() method. For example, passing the argument 5000 creates 
  a date that represents five seconds past midnight on 1/1/70.

  3.getUTCFullYear() -> The getUTCFullYear() method returns the year (four digits for dates 
    between year 1000 and 9999) of the specified date, according to 
    universal time.

The UTC methods calculate their date assuming that the date object is of 
local time and date.

The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) is the time set by the World 
Time Standard.
