we learn more about javaScript arrays.
In the js code, we sort and reverse an inputted numeric array.

- `array.sort()` By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings.

This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana").

However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".

Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting number

- `array.reverse()` reverses an array.
